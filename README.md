# Spherical Geometry
Playing with p5.js

![screen shot](https://github.com/PhilippeMarcMeyer/PhilippeMarcMeyer.github.io/blob/master/sphere.png?raw=true)

This is a translation in javascript/p5.js 
of Daniel Shiffman's coding challenge : 
Spherical Geometry from processing (java).
+ modifications of my own

For the background I used an offscreen 2D canvas to draw the stars and later textured it :
plane(640,480);
